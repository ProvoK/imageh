Lightweight library for reading images metadata.


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://imageh.readthedocs.io.

Why
-------

This lightweight library is focused on extracting all possible information from an image header without loading the entire bytes in memory.

I found PIL, despite being a very good library, lacks the possibility to do that. Moreover, PIL has a lot of dependencies.

Features
--------

* TODO
